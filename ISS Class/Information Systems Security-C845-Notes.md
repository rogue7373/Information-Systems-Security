# Notes For Information Systems Security - C845

## Getting started 
### 7 Domains
- Access Controls
- Security Operations and Administration
- Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis
- Incident Response and Recovery
- Cryptography
- Network and Communications Security
- Systems and Application Security

## Experience 
Candidates must have a minimum of 1 year cumulitive work experience in 1 or more of the 7 domains of the SSCP CBK. A 1 year prerequisite pathway will be granted for candidates who received a degree (bachelors or masters) in a cybersecurity program.

A candidate that doesn't have the required experience to become an SSCP may become an Associate of (ISC)2 by successfully passing the SSCP examination. The Associate of (ISC)2 will then have 2 years to earn the 1 year reqquired experience. You can more about SSCP experience requirements and how to account for part-time work and internships at www.ics2.org/Certifications/SSCP/experience-requirements

## SSCP Examination Weights

| Security Operations and Administration        | 15%    |
| Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis | 15%    |
| Incident Response and Recovery                | 13%    |
| Cryptography                                  | 10%    |
| Network and Communications Security           | 16%    |
